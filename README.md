# CI-CD-Pipeline-Implementation
Build a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a sample application. Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Travis CI to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Configure the pipeline to trigger on code changes and deploy the application to a staging or production environment.
